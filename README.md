# SB-PROFIT

This mod is created by using HyAuctions premium API. We are making this mod to let Skyblock players enjoy the flipper without having to play (like before),** BUT** with no 5min delay*.

**First things first**, you must have forge or a mod client compatibale with Hypixel, if you run this on cheat clients to run macros, you will be obviously banned. You have to be running on 1.8.9 for this mod to work since the newer versions don't let the liberty of the UI.

This mod allow the user to track the best items to auction flip on Hypixel Skyblock which makes the user able  to progress at a faster rate in the game. Once you've downloaded the mod, drag it into your "mods" folder, if you need help to find them; if you play on a Windows device, hold WIN+R and type "%appdata% in the run menu, then follow this path "AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods". If you don't have a "mods" folder, you can create one manually. If you play on a device running MacOS you can right-click you Finder application, then you click "Go on folder", type "~/Library/Application Support/minecraft" and you will find your folders like on Windows.

After you have your mod ready, you can launch your Minecraft in 1.8.9. When you are in Hypixel, there will be no chat message concerning the mod so you will have to type to command "/sbp", then the UI will pop up and you will be able to customize your notifications and the auction filters.

* You can change the delay to your liking up to 10 minutes (Not recommended for most profit).

Don't macro and have fun racing to the **#1!!!**
